Homework 5 - Data Simulation and De Bruijn Graph Construction

I used nested for loops in both simulate.py and assemble.py, so
assemble.py takes around 20-30 seconds to run.

Potential Bug - I could not get the programs to run with the command line input,
but they both worked when I hard coded in the arguments.

I did not attempt to make the .dot file output.

I discussed this project with Tim Brahm and I used www.geeksforgeeks.org for any python syntax
I needed a refresher on (like dictionaries and lists).
